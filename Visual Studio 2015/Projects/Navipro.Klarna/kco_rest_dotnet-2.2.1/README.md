# Klarna Checkout REST .NET SDK
[![NuGet Version][nuget-shield]](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Klarna.Rest/)

Klarna Checkout is a revolutionary payment solution that is changing the way
people shop online. First, consumers verify their purchase with the minimum
amount of information through intelligent identification, securing your order
immediately, and then complete their payment afterwards â€“ separating buying
from paying and dramatically increasing conversion. Klarna Checkout also allows
merchants to offer all payment methods through one supplier, minimizing
administration, costs and integration time.
